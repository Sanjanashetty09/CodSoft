The Titanic Survival Prediction task aims to predict the survival status of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, passenger class, and fare. 
The dataset used for this analysis contains information on Titanic passengers, including those who have survived and those who did not(target variable).
(Binary classification)

Steps done in the task:
1. Read the dataset
2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing- found out the total number of data, information, descriptive statistics of the dataframe, check for null values and handle them
3. Encoding for categorical data- using LabelEncoder, using the get_dummies from panda
4. Data Visualization:
     (i) Plot of number of males and females present onboard and number of them survived- this plot shows that none of the males onboard have survived and all the females survived
    (ii) Age distribution of passengers using histogram- from this graph we can conclude which age group of passengers were in large number
   (iii) Count of passengers based on the Class column- this represents on how survival was dependent on the Class of the passenger
5. Model Selection and Training- used two machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression and RandomForest Classifier
6. Model Evaluation- accuracy score and classification report
