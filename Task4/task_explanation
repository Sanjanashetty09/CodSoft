The Sales Prediction project aims to forecast the sales of a retail store using historical sales data 

Steps done in the task:
1. Read the dataset- advertising.csv
2. Data Exploration and preprocessing- statistical description of the dataframe, check for null values
3. Data Visualization- scatter plot of features vs target variable, boxplot to check for outliers
4. Model Selection and Training- Linear regression
5. Model Evaluation- score
6. Predict the sales value by giving the input for tv, radio and newspaper
